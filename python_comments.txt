There are 7 methods to add content to a screen.
The content is referred to as widgets.
Each widget must have a unique name which is passed in the ref argument.

- String widget method adds text at the specified x, y coordinates which are specified in character columns and rows:
    
    add_string_widget(ref, text, x, y)  

- The title widget displays centered text at the top of the screen with blocks on both sides.

    add_title_widget(ref, text)

- Horizontal and vertical Widgets draw bars at x, y coordinates and the length is measured in pixels.

    add_hbar_widget(ref, x, y, length)
    add_vbar_widget(ref, x, y, length)

- Icon Widget, Several icons are available such as arrows and hearts.

    add_icon_widget(ref, x, y, name)

    };


- Scroller widget displays scrolling text.  The direction argument can be h (horizontal), v (vertical or m (marquee).

    add_scroller_widget(ref, left, top, right, bottom, direction, speed, text)

- Number widgets are large font numbers which take up the full display height.  The value can only be 0 to 9 or 10 for a dash.

    add_number_widget(ref, x, value)  

Number widgets, icon widgets and the bar widgets all use custom characters. Therefore, only 1 of these 4 types can be used per screen.
